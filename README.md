# Speed of a Human Detector (C++17)

A computer-vision based speed estimation system that calculates human movement speed using frame differencing and centroid tracking.

## 🎯 Objective
Estimate the real-world walking/running speed of a person captured on video.

## 🛠️ Technical Highlights
- **OpenCV C++ API** for real-time image processing
- **Centroid tracking algorithm**
- **Frame-to-frame displacement estimation**
- **Basic calibration for pixel-to-meter conversion**

## 🚀 Features
- Motion detection from raw video frames
- Bounding box + centroid extraction
- Speed calculation (m/s or km/h)
- Adjustable thresholds for noise reduction


## 🧪 What This Demonstrates
- Strong C++/OpenCV proficiency  
- Signal & noise filtering understanding  
- Ability to design **deterministic image-processing pipelines**  
- Debugging of **real-time, frame-based systems**

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Kalman filter for smoother tracking  
- Camera calibration for higher accuracy  
- Support for multi-person tracking
